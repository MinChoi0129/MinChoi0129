### Introduction
I'm interested in Recognizing, Understanding, and Utilizing the "REAL WORLD SPACE", such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving systems. My dream just starts from these movies: *Iron Man*, *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*, and *The Avengers*. I hope the technologies in these movies come true.

### Tech Skills and Values
- Building clean environments using Docker and Anaconda for managing multiple CUDA versions and external library dependencies.
- Writing easy-to-read code that is accessible to everyone.
- Intermediate level understanding and development of SLAM systems.
- Experienced with Pytorch for deep learning (enhanced with ChatGPT).
- Developing applications based on Mediapipe (e.g., Human Pose and Hand Pose Estimation).
- Familiar with OS: Windows (10+), Ubuntu (18.04+).
- Proficient in Python for fast development, testing, and visualization (prefer Python 3.6+).
- C++ development for high-performance applications (prefer C++14+).
- Experienced with Unity (C#) for AR systems and 3D visualization (familiar with camera models, including intrinsic and extrinsic parameters).
- FastAPI-based front-end/back-end development and deployment.
- Flutter based mobile application development.
