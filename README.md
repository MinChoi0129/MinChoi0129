### Introduction
I'm interested in Recognizing, Understanding and Utilizing the "REAL WORLD SPACE", such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving system. My dream just starts from these two movies: 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. I hope the technologies in the movie come true.

### Tech Skills
- Familiar with Windows(10+), Ubuntu OS(18.04+).
- Pursuing clean environments using Docker and Anaconda for multiple CUDA, library dependencies.
- Pursuing easy-to-read code for everyone.
- Python based fast development skill for quick and simple tests and visualizations. (prefer 3.6+)
- C++ based development if faster performance is required. (prefer C++14+)
- Unity(C#) based AR system, 3D Visualization. (familiar with camera model such as in/extrinsic parameters)
- FastAPI based frontend/backend development with deployment.

### Papers
