### Introduction
I'm interested in Recognizing, Understanding and Utilizing the "REAL WORLD SPACE", such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving system. My dream just starts from these movies: 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and 'Avengers'. I hope the technologies in the movie come true.

### Tech Skills and Values
- Pursuing clean environments using Docker and Anaconda for multiple CUDA, external library dependencies.
- Pursuing easy-to-read code for everyone.
- Middle Level Comprehension about SLAM systems.
- Pytorch for Deep Learning (better with ChatGPT)
- Familiar OS: Windows(10+), Ubuntu(18.04+).
- Python based fast development skill for quick and simple tests and visualizations. (prefer 3.6+)
- C++ based development if faster performance is required. (prefer C++14+)
- Unity(C#) based AR system, 3D Visualization. (familiar with camera model such as in/extrinsic parameters)
- FastAPI based frontend/backend development with deployment.
